      'How is Strove.io any better than running code on the personal computer?',
    paragraph: `There are several problems programmers face that can be solved by using a remote approach:
      1. Companies need to buy and manage expensive equipment for each developer.
      Strove allows developers to work on their own computers while still allowing companies to secure code or even, recover it.
      2. It's hard to secure the code.
      Storing code on remote servers allows to recover code or restrict access.
      3. Programmers often waste a lot of time on setting up the environment.
      Strove.io removes the need to set a programming environment for each and every developer.
      4. 'It works on my machine'.
      Because all team members access instances of the same programming environment the code works the same way no matter the computer used.
    `,

  {
    header: 'Is Strove.io secure?',
    paragraph: `We wrote Strove.io with security in mind. We store code in state of the art cloud provider - Google Cloud and all the connections to the it are encrypted using SSL to prevent third parties from hijacking any kind of information.
      Projects in Strove.io are run within Docker containers and because of that files used within a project are not accessible to unauthorized users.
      Many tech-forward companies are trying to store as much code in the cloud as possible as it\x27s easier to steal it from physical devices. Security advantage over using traditional way of coding is one of the reasons we started working on Strove.io.`,

    paragraph:
      'Aforementioned providers only allow apps to clone if the user is logged in.',
  },
  {
    header: 'How to manage env variables?',
    paragraph: `To add environment variables create a file that will store them such as .env.development.
      Environment variables will be stored inside your project alone and they will not be shared, as long as files they live in are ignored by git.
      This prevents users from accidentally sharing them even if you share your project using a link such as https://strove.io/#https://github.com/stroveio/2048-clone.`,

    header:
      'I am not able to preview my application from within the IDE even though server is running! What should I do?',
    paragraph:
      'This is most likely due to your app not running on host 0.0.0.0. Some frameworks and servers choose a different port and you can almost always specify that you want host 0.0.0.0 instead.',
  },
  {
    header: 'Can I work on mobile apps or Windows/MacOS apps?',
    paragraph: `Yes and no. Here is an overview:
Strove runs code on Linux-based virtual machines and nearly anything that works on Linux Ubuntu works on Strove as well.
Mobile development using solutions such as React Native and Expo or native desktop development using solutions such as Electorn is possible.
You won't be able to use Strove if you rely on Windows or MacOS environments. This includes working on iPhone apps using XCode.

        We run multiple projects on one machine using Docker and two users could
        use the same ports if we did not implement the limit. Docker requires
        specifying which ports should the user take so to support any number of
        ports, we would have to let the first user take all the ports. If this
