1. A new Docker container is started on one of virtual machines.

Strove runs code on Linux-based virtual machines and nearly anything that works on Linux Ubuntu works on Strove as well.
Mobile development using solutions such as React Native and Expo or native desktop development using solutions such as Electorn is possible.
You won't be able to use Strove if you rely on Windows or MacOS environments. This includes working on iPhone apps using XCode.
