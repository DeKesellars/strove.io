All the projects are run within Docker containers to make sure files used within a project are not accessible to unauthorized users. Many tech-forward companies are trying to store as much code in the cloud as possible as it\x27s easier to steal it from physical decides and this is one of the reasons we started working on Strove.io.',

1. A new Docker container is started on one of virtual machines.
2. Strove provides read and write access to the project folder.
3. Strove clones your repository from a chosen git provider.
4. Init script from strove.json is run if it's present.`,

Strove runs code on Linux-based virtual machines and nearly anything that works on Linux Ubuntu works on Strove as well.
Mobile development using solutions such as React Native and Expo or native desktop development using solutions such as Electorn is possible.
You won't be able to use Strove if you rely on Windows or MacOS environments. This includes working on iPhone apps using XCode.
